# LearningRuby
Exercises are placed here as I work through them. Many of these are pulled from the exercises crowd-sourced on website codewars.com. I hope to show my progress as my skill at coding develops, and show how I face code challenges as I build this portfolio.

## Update: 3/3/2020
This exploded into an absolute passion for tech, and all things code. I didn't stick with Ruby, I ended up wanting a CS degree so badly I put this down and taught myself math until I could get into Calculus 1. I am now working through an accredited college CS210 class with a focus on Java, and a list of future personal coding projects I'm excited to work on this summer. These commits mark the start of a huge journey forward with my life into a new passion.
