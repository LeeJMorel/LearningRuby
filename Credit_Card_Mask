Instructions: Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

Examples
maskify('4556364607935616') # should return '############5616'
maskify('64607935616')      # should return '#######5616'
maskify('1')                # should return '1'
maskify('')                 # should return ''

# "What was the name of your first pet?"
maskify('Skippy')                                   # should return '##ippy'
maskify('Nananananananananananananananana Batman!') # should return '####################################man!'

Solution:
def maskify(cc)

  if cc.length <= 4
      #.size would also work here instead of .length
    return cc
      #returtning if the number was less than 4 allowed me to provide a simple exception rather than having to split into strings from the original data array
  else
   "#" * (cc.length-4) + cc [-4..-1]
      #the first part of the equation works because it didn't matter which 4 it subtracted from the array in order to display the correct amount of "#". From there it was just adding the correct range to the end of the converted data.
   end
end
