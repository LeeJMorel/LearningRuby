Instructions:
Consider an array of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
The correct answer would be 17.

Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined

Solution:
def countSheeps array
    array.compact.count(true) 
      #compact removes all nil elements in an array
      #.size or .length would have also worked instead of .count, so long as it only looks for arguement "true"
end
